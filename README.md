# pisschat
pissy TCP chat client/server made with wxpython

# clients
pisschat-client-wx contains a cross-platform GUI client made with wxpython, there are also pre-compiled binaries for amd64 linux and windows because i forgot to leave them out when i published this
you can also use the terminal-client.py which has the same functionality as the wxpython version (to change your name type !set-name \[name])

# server
run server.py to run a server that both wxpython and terminal clients can connect to, you can use ngrok or port forward ur stuff to make it available for other people
